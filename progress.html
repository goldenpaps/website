    <h1>Progress page!!</h1>

    <p><center>as an introduction to this page ill give a brief rundown of the project i've been working on for about half a year:</center><br>
    <p><center>Essentially, I've been working on developing a 'smart' wheelchair </center><br>
    <p><center>The big focus has been navigation assitance and safety</center>
    <p><center>The goal is to develop a product that can assist in the independent travel of wheelchair users</center>
    <p><center>This applies more to those with severe disabilities who are incapable of travel by themselves</center>
    <p><center>This is a big step towards independent living and ease of daily life for people who depend on wheelchairs.</center>
    <p><center>Personally, I've worked with the safety features in the camera realm</center>
    <p><center>We use a depth camera to detect objects and how far they are from the user</center>
    <p><center>I only really helped with configuration and havent gotten to work much with this, but I really look forward to it!</center>
    <p><center>I'd like to write a script that continuously checks the visual feed for terrain issues or objects that might be an issue</center>
    <p><center>The big thing that I have worked on is the navigation assistance</center>
    <p><center>To work on this, I first built a python script for ROUGH global positioning using the local IP as a prototype</center>
    <p><center>When this worked, I then began working on other ways to increase accuracy of the program</center>
    <p><center>Eventually, I (dr.Azab) purchased a usb gps module. It was super cool to interface with it and see how it worked</center>
    <p><center>So I then wrote a python script to use the information that the GPS module gave</center>
    <p><center>The gps module returns very precise coordinates</center>
    <p><center>The coordinates can be used to give an exact location (much better than IP based)</center>
    <p><center>Then, with the implementation of AI into the python script, the user can now </center>
    <p><center>Request to go to a location and be given step-by-step directions to that location</center>
    <p><center>The user is also told an estimated time of travel by wheelchair and estimated distance of travel</center>
    <p><center>It was super fun to work with and I was so proud when it worked</center>
    <p><center>I have lots of future plans for this project lined up, first being indor navigation without gps</center>
    <p><center>Until then I am working on getting input from people with disabilities as to how this could help them</center>
    <p><center>If you know anyone who may be impacted by this work, feel free to send the survey link to them:</center>
    <p><center>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekDn8abm7cgisNGGJNtbZXOuSshNq_3gm0KokhuhcNN4LbSw/viewform?usp=dialog</center>
    <p><center>So far I have gotten a few responses fromthe survey which is so cool and it makes me super happy</center>
    <p><center>I hope to implement some of the things that people frequently request if feesable.</center>
    <p><center>On top of this i've been making an effort to reach out in public to people in wheelchairs and just see whats up</center>
    <p><center>I met one guy named Alex when I was in Texas for an internship. I walked to his place with him from the store</center>
    <p><center>He told me that the biggest issue he faces is incline, as he did not have a very modern chair.</center>
    <p><center>Stuff like that is great because it gave me firsthand experience to see how important things like motor assitance</center>
    <p><center>Can be for people</center>
    <p><center>Im working on a lot more with the project now and hopefully I can upload some pics to this page soon</center>
    <p><center>If you actually read through this - or just any of it - thank you very much.</center>
