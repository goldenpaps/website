  <p>There are gonna be a bunch of different projects on here</p>
    <h1>Xploit info</h1>
    
    <p>if on windows here are the tools you will need to conduct payload based exploits on oher windows systems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Metaploit</li>
      <li>NASM or MASM (i prefer NASM)</li>
      <li>Hex editor of ur choice, I use HXD</li>
      <li>notepad editing works, but notepad++ is better</li>
      <li>Oracle Virtualbox manager (dont do this on ur home windows device plz use a VM)</li>
      <li>WinDBG on Host VM</li>
      <li>any version of python</li>
      <li>shellcode launcher of some sort</li>
      <li>Ghidra is great for checking files to make sure theyre functioning properly. especially when dealing eith ASM.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Setup steps</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create 2 VMS in VB manager.</li>
      <li>Memory & processing power are not a concern for either</li>
      <li>For the <strong>HOST</strong> VM you will have 2 network adapters. The first will be NAT, Cable Connected. The second will be Host-only adapter (name VB host only ethernet adapter). Deny prom mode and cable connected.</li>
      <li>The second VM will only have 1 network adapter. Connect it to host-only adapter the same as the last step. This way your Host VM is connected to internet but the target vm is isolated while connected to the host.</li>
      <li>WinDbg only on host adapter btw</li>
      <li>To connect the debugger run this on ur target vm</li>
      <li>Reboot after running this (Assumes windows 8.0+)</li>
      <li>bcedit -set TESTSIGNING ON<br>
      bcedit -set loadoptions DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS<br>
      bcedit /debug on<br>
      rem Win8+<br>
      rem ip = hostip<br>
      rem port = 50000...50099<br>
      rem key = aything you want z.z.z.z<br>
      bcedit /dbgsettings net hostip:192.168.56.101 port:50000 key:1.2.3.4</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Metasploit steps</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For my purposes, this is a fun way to exploit the calc app. So this is a tutorial on how to do so. The methods here can be used maliciously but of course i don't know how / wouldnt show you if i did</li>
      <li>with the metaspoit framework installed ( i use version 6.3.39 but its similar for all) open an admin cmd promt</li>
      <li>Navigate to your desktop (cd\users\_____\desktop)</li>
      <li>generate the shellcode payload by typing this: msfvenom -f python -p windows/exec cmd=calc exitfunc=process</li>
      <li>another version of this uses an exitfunction regarding safe SEH: msfvenom -f python -p windows/exec exitfunc=seh cmdd=calc but idc what u do</li>
      <li>It will output your payload. Cool! Now copy that, and create a python file where u will paste it.</li>
      <li>if u dont know how, just create a text file, paste the payload, and rename the extension rom .txt to .py</li>
      <li>Your python file should say the following under the payload:<br>
      file = open("payload.bin", "wb")<br>
      file.write(buf)<br>
      file.close
      </li>
      <li>navigate to the locaiton of this python file in cmd prompt. </li>
      <li>...>python nameofscript.py</li>
      <li>it will create a file called payload.bin that contains the raw shellcode<li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>shared folder</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Seting up a folder share will just make everythign easier for transferring work between vms</li>
      <li>in host vm make a folder > properties > sharing >advanced sharing > permissions > allow all</li>
      <li>in target vm files > map network drive > x: > \\192.168.56.101\sample > check reconnect at sign in > finish</li>
      <li>send that .bin file from the python sript to the target vm</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <p>testing</p>
    <ul>
      <li>in your target vm open an admim cmd prompt</li>
      <li>navigate to desktop</li>
      <li>Shellcodelauncher.exe whatever.bin</li>
      <li>Should run whatever exploit you have written in shellcode if ur stuff is right</li>
      <li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>editing</p>
    <ul>
      <li>throw the resulting .bin file into your hex editor</li>
      <li>it will display all of the raw bytes nd all of the characters associated with them</li>
      <li>To work with x86 asm, put the .bin file into ghidra, open it using x86 little endian 32 visual studio</li>
      <li>Copy all of the asm instructions into a text file (change extension from .txt to .asm)</li>
      <li>edit the asm file to whatever you want</li>
      <li>navigate to wherever the asm file is located in a cmd prompt > nasm filename.asm -o output.bin</li>
      <li>this creates your new .bin file with the chnages you made in assembly.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>and that should be everything you need to do some fun stuff with payload exploits!</p>
  
  
  <h2>WiFi Deauthenticator (not done)</h2>
  <p> Full honesty this took me forever to get</p><br>
  <p>There are 2 parts and the 2nd is completely optional. Does not affect the workings</p><br>
  
  <p>Required tools:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>ESP32 microcontroller (nonspecific)</li>
  <li> some version of vscode</li>
  <li>This weird plugin with vscode that allows uploading to board from vscode: platformIO</li>
  <li>If you want easier setup use arduino for simple lobrary management</li>
  </ul>
